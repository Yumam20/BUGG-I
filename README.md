# BUGG-I
Buggy Interactive Display for TartanHacks 2022


Buggy is a CMU Tradition. Piloted by a driver and pushed through five hills by five separate pushers, the gravity pod can reach up to 40mph during the roll. Making this possible is the team, some with over 60 members, who work tirelessly over the course of an year to make sure they get the fastest time on the course come Raceday in April, a heat usually taking 2 minutes. With the nature of how competitive it is, you would imagine that drivers have an awareness for how fast their time is at practice. Short answer, no. Secluded from the outside world, the driver gauges on his/her metric to see what they believe works and is the fastest line. BUGG-I is a product that would help alleviate this by informing the driver of their current sector time, and other valuable quantative data to help them improve their times for race day.
